# TODO

DONE: 2025-06-16: Les spatial_atome_indcvi ont des polygones redondants, il faut les supprimer (cf. insee.rp ou insee.admin)

<!-- ## Data Compression   -->
<!-- This package uses `LazyDataCompression: mixed` (some datasets compressed with `xz`, others with `bzip2`). -->

## Data Compression and Size  
This package contains large datasets compressed with `xz` (optimal compression).  
- Total installed size: ~160.1Mb  
- Primary use: [Briefly explain why the data is large, e.g., "high-resolution spatial data for France"]  
- To reduce local disk usage, load only needed datasets with `data("dataset_name", package = "mapuce.data.2020")`. 

## Data File Naming Convention

Files follow `{dataset}_{zone}_{rp_year}.rda` format:
- `spatial_iris_ZONE_A_2020.rda`: 2020 RP data with 2022 admin borders
<!-- - `mapuce_indcvi_FRA_2018.rda`: 2018 RP data with 2020 admin borders -->

| File Pattern | Contents |
|--------------|----------|
| `*_2020.rda` | RP 2020 + Admin 2022 |
| `*_2018.rda` | RP 2018 + Admin 2020 |

The goal of mapuce.data.2020 is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of mapuce.data.2020 like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mapuce.data.2020)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
